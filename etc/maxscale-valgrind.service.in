# MaxScale with Valgrind
#
# This systemd service file runs MaxScale with Valgrind and differs from the
# real MaxScale service file mainly by the fact that it is a notify type
# service. The watchdog timeout is also set to a higher value to cope with the
# fact that valgrind makes things about ten times as slow as normal.
#
# The environment variables LOGNAME and HOST define the files that Valgrind used
# when it's interacting with vgdb. To connect to MaxScale while under Valgrind,
# define the LOGNAME and HOST environment variables to the same ones that are
# here.
